# Odin_Project-Sign-up-Form

This is a project to create a website called ODIN.

## Overview

The project consists of a single HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS file (`styles.css`). It is designed to showcase the layout and styling of the ODIN website.

## Getting Started

To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Design Assets

- **Background Image:** The background image used in the design can be found in `background-image.jpg`.
- **External Font:** The selected font for the 'ODIN' logo is 'Norse Bold'. Ensure it is correctly linked in the CSS file.
- **Sidebar Image:** The image used in the sidebar is `odin-logo.jpg`.

## Implementation Notes

- The project is designed to be responsive, primarily focusing on desktop resolutions.
- Basic form validation is implemented using CSS classes for error indication and input focus styling.
- JavaScript can be added later for more advanced form validation, such as password matching.
